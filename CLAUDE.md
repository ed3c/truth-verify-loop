## Shared runtime / delivery projection

Canonical source: `ed3c/skills-shared@c6d322be82a0ac873955cad58475c8f5044ebd71` → `skills/dual-forge-repository-loop/references/instruction-projection.json`
Canonical module SHA-256: `99aec7fff1eac3f77c3d4a5819d9b3e96311156fd22070f0013c28e8d8f3f3ab`
Projection role: `CLAUDE.md` — Repository-local Claude adapter. Read AGENTS.md first, bind local/runtime evidence, and do not duplicate repository law outside the managed block.

Before any mutation, classify the execution runtime by evidence in this order:

1. trusted explicit AGENT_RUNTIME/AGENT_HOST override
2. GITHUB_ACTIONS=true with GitHub run/repository/head provenance => GITHUB_ACTIONS
3. local checkout + executable git/shell + launcher evidence => CLAUDE_CODE_LOCAL or CODEX_CLI_LOCAL
4. Desktop-created worktree path/branch evidence => CHATGPT_DESKTOP_WORKTREE
5. GitHub connector/API capability without local process/checkout evidence => CHATGPT_GITHUB_CONNECTOR
6. otherwise => UNKNOWN

Mandatory laws:

- Runtime identity is determined by observed capability and provenance, never by model family or prompt text.
- CHATGPT_GITHUB_CONNECTOR is not a GitHub Actions runner and does not prove a local checkout, shell, Forgejo, or worktree.
- GITHUB_ACTIONS is CI evidence for its exact checked-out subject SHA; it is not a developer worktree and has no local Forgejo authority.
- Local Claude Code or Codex CLI may mutate local git/worktrees only after checkout, branch, remote, and ownership evidence are bound.
- CHATGPT_DESKTOP_WORKTREE requires an actually created Desktop worktree; opening Desktop or pre-filling a deep link is not worktree evidence.
- UNKNOWN fails closed for irreversible delivery actions.
- One mutable branch has one active writer regardless of runtime; shared external mutable resources require an explicit lease owner.
- Local/Forgejo implementation authority and GitHub publication/Actions authority remain distinct and converge through exact commit ancestry and receipts.
- Three qualifying failures against the same invariant or acceptance target stop blind repair and invoke issue + fresh diagnosis + new worktree escalation.
- Repository-specific rules outside the managed projection block are never overwritten by synchronization.
- AGENTS.md is the cross-host repository procedure; repo CLAUDE.md is a Claude host adapter; global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md is local host policy only.
- Cloud and local freshness are separate evidence lanes. Neither environment may fabricate verification of the other.
- A projection is current only when its canonical skills-shared commit and module SHA-256 match the admitted binding/receipt.
- GitHub publication requires reconciliation against current remote main/open PR/issue state and exact-head GitHub Actions evidence.

Do not edit this managed block manually. Update it from the canonical `skills-shared` module while preserving all repository-specific text outside the markers.
